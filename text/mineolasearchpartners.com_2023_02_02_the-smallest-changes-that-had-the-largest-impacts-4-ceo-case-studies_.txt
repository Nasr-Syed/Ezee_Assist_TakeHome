Each CEO that I’ll be speaking with today is at a different stage of their journey: Betsy, who I’ll begin the episode with, is still in her first year in the CEO seat. Sheret, our next leader, has been CEO of his company for ~2 years. Robin Kovitz has been leading her company for ~8 years, and finally Adrian, our final CEO, ran his company for ~7 years before a successful exit to a strategic acquiror in 2019. Does growth and success tend to result from a large number of seemingly small changes, or a small number or larger changes? That’s what we’ll endeavor to answer today, informed by 4 CEOs at very different stages of their respective journeys.
