Are they genuinely helpful? Are they regularly available? Do they genuinely understand the personal and professional journey that you’re on? Do they create an environment in which searchers and CEOs feel safe and comfortable approaching them with problems and opportunities? Investors shouldn’t need to do any marketing themselves: The searchers and CEOs with whom they work should do all of their “marketing” for them. Reputation speaks volumes. If you are considering raising a search fund or acquiring a company yourself, I would encourage you to call or email any of the entrepreneurs below and simply ask them what it’s like to work with me. Though I’m certainly not perfect, I’m confident that each entrepreneur with whom I work will be able to tell you exactly the type of investor and (more importantly) the type of person that I am.
